and sold off. A car which is currently with the company can be in one of these three states: it may have
gone for repair, it may be available, it may be rented out. If it is rented out, the company records the data
and time when it has been rented out, and the mile-meter reading of the car at that time. The company
also wants to maintain the amount of maintenance expense each vehicle incurs.

of money spent on repairs for the car, average demand, revenue earned by renting out the car, and fuel
consumption of the car. Based on these statistics, the company may take a decision about which vehicles
are more profitable. The statistics can also be used to decide the charge for different types of vehicles.
