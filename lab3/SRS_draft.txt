-----------------------------------
3 External Interface Requirements
-----------------------------------
--------------------
3.1 User Interfaces
--------------------
There are two base views. 
Client side user interface for renting vehicles.
Company/server side user interface for management and data collection.
Both views will run on different machines with possible one to many relation b/w server and client views.
------------------------
3.2 Hardware Interfaces
------------------------
The system would need a computer to run on both sides. 
Client side should have minimum hardware requirements of a internet connectivity supported machine with at least 512 MB of RAM and 1 GB of storage space.
Server side would need to cater to multiple clients and hence needs significant compute power. It should have basic server setup and internet connectivity.
------------------------
3.3 Software Interfaces
------------------------
The storage of data should be organised in a database. The system views for server and client should be in the form of GUI or at least CLIs.
-------------------------------
3.4 Communication Interfaces
-------------------------------
Network connectivity is required for client and server to communicated with each other. The database also needs to communicate with the server side similar to a MVP architecture.

-------------------
4. System Features
-------------------
We arrange the system features in a functional hierarchy as that makes the most sense for this product â€“ Transport Automation Vehicle System. We have three main features of TAVS. First, renting of cars. It is of utmost importance as this feature generates the revenue for the company and will the customer facing. Second, vehicle management. This is important backend feature for the company. Third, data collection and analysis. This is of lower priority than the other two features but will be useful in making the company more effecient and profitable in longer run.

5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements
-------------------------------------
These requirements do not form the core of the software being developed but do play a major role in the percieved reliabilty and likeability for the users.
-----------------------------
5.1 Performance Requirements
-----------------------------
--------------------
5.1.1 Response Time 
--------------------
The response time should be within the human visual system resolution ie 10ms. The user may tolerate upto 1s but above that would be a potential for the user to get annoyed and may switch products.
-----------------
5.1.2 Capacity
-----------------
The scale of the software should be sufficient for production environment. 
Atleast 100 users at one time can access the system.
Atleast 100 vehicles should be supported by the system.

----------------------------------
5.1.3 Availability vs Consistency
----------------------------------
The availability of the system should be above 90%. That is atleast 9 out of 10 times, the user should be able to access the system in a given time period. Consistency is important during the booking phase and availability of data in monitoring the vehicles.

---------------------------
5.1.4 Errors and Debugging
