We arrange the system features in a functional hierarchy as that makes the most sense for this product â€“ Transport Automation Vehicle System. We have three main features of TAVS. First, renting of cars. It is of utmost importance as this feature generates the revenue for the company and will the customer facing. Second, vehicle management. This is important backend feature for the company. Third, data collection and analysis. This is of lower priority than the other two features but will be useful in making the company more effecient and profitable in longer run.
