###Activity
* One important point should be clearly understood that an activity diagram cannot be exactly matched with the code
* Partitions provide a constrained view on the behaviors invoked in activities. Constraints could be selected according to the type of the element that the partition represents. The following constraints are normative (standard) in UML 2.4:
	* classifier
	* instance
	* part
	* attribute and value
