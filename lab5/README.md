# Lab 5 - System Design
## Address 'how' part
1. DB design
2. Implementation schedule
3. Cost-benefit analysis
4. Alternative solutions

## Structure Chart
Diagram notation tool for system architecture representation
* Higher level modules coordinate and control
* Lower level modules do i/o and processing

#### Notations

* Data flow - A directed arrow with empty circle at the end represents data flow.
* Control flow - A directed arrow with filled circle at the end represents control flow. 

DFD can be [converted](http://120.105.184.250/lwcheng/SSADM/%E5%9C%96%E8%A1%A8/DFD_%E7%B5%90%E6%A7%8B%E5%9C%96/Strategies%20for%20converting%20the%20DFD%20into%20Structure%20Chart.htm) to structure chart.

## Software Design Document
1. Introduction
2. Problem Specification: include here the data-flow diagrams, entry-relationship diagrams or class diagrams
3. Software structure: give the high-level software structure chart identifying major modules and major data elements in their interfaces
4. Data Definitions: for major data structure, files and database
5. Module Specifications: Indicate inputs, outputs, purpose and subordinates modules for each software modules
6. Requirements Tracing: Indicates which modules meet which requirements
